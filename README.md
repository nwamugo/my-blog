## Development server

After building, run `npm run scully:serve` for a dev server that stays running. Navigate to `http://localhost:1668/`. Note: You have to do the build process again if you introduce new static files.

## Code scaffolding

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
